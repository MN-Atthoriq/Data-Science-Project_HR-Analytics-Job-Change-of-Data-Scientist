    "Ascencio, a leading Data Science agency, offers training courses to companies to enhance their employees' skills. Companies want to predict which employees are **unlikely to seek a job change** after completing the course, as well as identify those who are **likely to finish it quickly**. By focusing on employees who are committed to staying and can contribute sooner, Ascencio helps companies optimize their training investments.\n",

    "To achieve this, Ascencio will build two machine learning models: one to predict the training hours needed for an employee to complete the course, and another to predict whether an employee will seek a job change or not."
